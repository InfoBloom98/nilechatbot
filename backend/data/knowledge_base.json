Students with carry-over courses are also allowed to re-take these courses during the long vacation semester. Students with outstanding courses from previous levels, such as transfer students, may also be allowed to take these courses during the summer semester. Summer semester course offerings are limited, and students are generally only allowed to take a maximum of 15 credits during this semester. This means that a student can take a maximum of five 3-credit courses or seven 2-credit courses."
